# Helmet Detection using YOLOv8, DeepSORT

---

## Overview

This repository contains code for detecting helmets in images using the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm. Two datasets, one for good weather conditions and one for bad weather conditions, were utilized for training and testing the model. The datasets were annotated using Roboflow and exported in Jupyter Notebook format. Image enhancement techniques, specifically Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), were applied to improve the quality of the images before training.
